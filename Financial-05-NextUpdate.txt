# FinancialAM-05 :: Console Line Interactive Application
# Recent updates on the "main" branch:
#   >>> Multiple registered accounts, fixing minor bugs.
#
# Noticing on next future updates:
#     > Implementing the logout profile account system,
#       since it's not so convenient to having to stay
#       logged on even after closing the app without the
#       free will of the users.
#     > Implementing the fourth and fifth features, since
#       both of them already done in base implementations
#       and just need a UI to make them more interactive
#       with the users.
#     > Implementing the recovery profile account menu
#       section, and for the progress is still on work
#       but soon will be done, just making sure that the
#       file to make the user keep logged on within 30
#       days already intact in the "ApplicationLoginMenu"
#       function.
#     > Implementing the trial version of horizontal
#       histogram CLI mode, since working with libraries
#       requires more time to come with an understanding
#       on how the basis works, since we can't embed the
#       C code here with Python codes using "matplotlib"
#       and other computer science libraries in Python.
